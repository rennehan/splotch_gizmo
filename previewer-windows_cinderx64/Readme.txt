The application is written in the C++ language using Cinder libraries version 0.9.0. 
Cinder: https://libcinder.org/

Currently tested and supported datatypes are:
Gadget
RAMSES

The application can be launched from the exe in this folder. Or from building it using the Visual Studio project and making sure the linker settings are correct.

The exe will launch a window where you can select your parameter file. You should double check the parameters are correct within the program, and then hit load.
Camera control is done via clicking and dragging the mouse.
Parameters for the render can be performed once the visulisation has loaded.
